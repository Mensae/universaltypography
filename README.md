# Universal Typography demo

This is an experimental tool based on Tim Brown’s [Universal Typography](http://universaltypography.com/) talks and principles. It shows how typesetting decisions for the web apply in many contexts — revealing the multidimensional nature of a single typographic element (in this case, a paragraph). It also demonstrates how font metrics data can help guide good typographic decisions.

[See the demo](http://universaltypography.com/demo). Originally debuted at An Event Apart, Atlanta 2015.

## How do I use this?

Play with this experiment and study it. Choose a font, and make decisions about type size, measure, and leading. Modify and instantiate contexts, to see how your decisions might apply if a user has a very narrow screen or a large default font size. Then adjust your typesetting decisions to see how they apply across different contexts.
